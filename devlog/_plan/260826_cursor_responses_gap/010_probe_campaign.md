# 010 — Probe campaign (wp2 decade doc)

Instrument: local proxy `localhost:10100` /v1/responses, opencodex
2.32.1-preview.20260825. Subject: `cursor/grok-4.6`. Controls:
`xai/grok-4.6` (C1), `cursor/claude-opus-5` + `cursor/gemini-3.7-flash`
(C2). Subagent fleet: native spawn_agent — sol medium default + explicit
cursor-model workers (S1), plugin-surface exposure (S2), all fenced to
read-only tasks or mktemp scratch.

Verifier (from 000 plan):
`rg -c '^\| (P|C|S)[0-9]' devlog/_plan/260826_cursor_responses_gap/010_probe_campaign.md`
pass condition >= 10 evidence rows.

Bounds: <=30 live probes, <=3 retries/class, ~40min wall clock.

## Evidence rows

| P3a | single tool | cursor/grok-4.6 | PASS* | function_call get_weather {"city":"Seoul"} emitted; call_id contains embedded NEWLINE: "call-9aee...-0\nfc_5a1a...__0" — two ids glued with \n |
| P4a | multi tool parallel | cursor/grok-4.6 | PASS* | 2 function_calls (Seoul, Tokyo) in one response; same newline call_id shape on both |
| P5a | tool-result round trip | cursor/grok-4.6 | PASS | echoed newline call_id accepted back; final "21°C sunny"; in=10346 |
| P6a | apply_patch freeform | cursor/grok-4.6 | PASS | custom_tool_call with valid "*** Begin Patch\n*** Add File: hello.txt\n+alpha\n+beta\n*** End Patch" envelope; in=1078 |

| P8a | reasoning item replay | cursor/grok-4.6 | PASS* | reasoning item in input accepted (no 4xx); answer "apple" correct; reasoning_tokens=0 in ALL cursor responses (reasoning never surfaced) |
| P9a-c | concurrent x3 | cursor/grok-4.6 | PASS | 3 parallel curls all HTTP 200, 3.4-4.0s, correct N1/N2/N3, no cross-talk |
| P11a | 5-turn tool chain | cursor/grok-4.6 | PASS | t1 call slot A -> t2 result 41 -> t3 call slot B -> t4 result 59 -> t5 sum "100" correct. in_tokens: 268 -> 10383 -> 10405 -> 10640 -> 10744 |
| P12a | 77KB ANSI/unicode tool result | cursor/grok-4.6 | PASS | ESC bytes + 한글 survived round trip; model read TOTAL_CHARS=77400 correctly; in=33341 |
| C1a | control: tool round trip | xai/grok-4.6 | PASS | same P5 shape; in=529 (vs cursor 10346 — 20x smaller) |

| P13b | stream + custom (exec) tool | cursor/grok-4.6 | PASS* | custom_tool_call_input delta/done ok; note response.heartbeat event emitted (non-standard); tool input "await tools.exec_command({ command: \"date\" })" — wrong arg name (cmd vs command), model-side |
| S1a | subagent real task | cursor/grok-4.6 (Noether) | PASS* | 4-line file via apply_patch completed BUT: apply_patch rejections mid-task, duplicate round2-ok line collapsed, one ls "came back empty", agent wrote receipts OUTSIDE scratch fence (.codexclaw/evidence in repo), needed 3 hook-forced verification attempts |
| S1b | subagent real task | gpt-5.6-sol medium (Nash) | PASS | notes_sol-medium.md 4 lines correct; no incidents; finished but stayed unreaped until close (interrupted at close) |
| S1c | subagent real task | cursor/gemini-3.7-flash (Cicero) | PASS | notes + receipt written, self-reported PASS; also stayed unreaped |
| S2a | subagent plugin surface | cursor/grok-4.6 (Ramanujan) | FAIL | completed the probe (shell ok, Chrome screenshot ok, Codex-app screenshot policy-blocked as designed) THEN degenerated: ~180 consecutive identical exec calls ("BYTES:1646 EXISTS:true"), never terminated, closed manually |

## Per-probe notes

### P1a (smoke, pre-campaign)

Request: `{"model":"cursor/grok-4.6","input":"Reply with exactly: PONG","stream":false,"store":false}`.
Observation: correct text, but input_tokens=11913 for an 6-word prompt —
the adapter injects its full system/tool preamble even for a bare request.
Flag for 020: token-cost floor.

### Cross-cutting observations (curl phase)

1. **Token floor**: every cursor-route request pays a ~10-15K input-token
   preamble (P1a 11913, P5a 10346, P8a 10174, C2b 14846) even with zero
   caller tools; xai route pays 229-529 for identical shapes. The adapter
   injects its native tool catalog + system scaffolding unconditionally.
   P3a is the exception (in=272): when the caller supplies function tools,
   the preamble collapses — the floor comes from the DEFAULT native
   toolset advertisement.
2. **call_id newline gluing** (P3a/P4a): the Responses-visible call_id is
   `call-<uuid>-<n>\nfc_<uuid>_<n>` — two identifiers joined by a literal
   newline. Round-trip works (P5a) because the adapter parses its own
   format, but any client that logs, splits, or validates call_ids on
   line boundaries breaks. Responses API ids are opaque but
   single-line by convention everywhere else.
3. **reasoning_tokens always 0** on cursor route (all probes) while
   xai/grok-4.6 emits a reasoning item + reasoning_tokens=143 for the
   same prompt: grok-4.6's thinking is either not requested or dropped
   by the cursor adapter — consistent with 001 S1 (reasoning never
   replayed for external wire models, protobuf-request.ts:237).
4. **cursor/claude-opus-5 dead in catalog** (C2a): advertised by
   /v1/models but every request fails upstream not_found. Catalog-serving
   honesty gap.
5. **No response.in_progress SSE event** (P2a) — minor spec parity gap.
6. Multi-turn continuity via previous_response_id (P7, P11) WORKS at the
   Responses surface — the seed thread's S1 re-orientation is therefore
   NOT a hard continuity break; it is the replay REPRESENTATION
   (flattened text + dropped reasoning) that causes re-orientation, plus
   in_tokens jumping 268 -> 10383 after the first tool round (P11a:
   checkpoint not reused across the tool boundary; full-replay fallback,
   001 S1 mechanism confirmed by token accounting).

### Subagent-phase observations (S1/S2 + user session reports)

7. **Degenerate tool-call loop (S2a, live)**: after finishing its task, the
   cursor/grok-4.6 subagent repeated the byte-identical exec call ~180
   times ("BYTES:1646 EXISTS:true" x180 in its transcript) without ever
   emitting a final answer. The flattened-text history replay (001 S1)
   makes each round look like "someone verified bytes, verify again" —
   no structured turn state to signal completion. Highest-severity live
   confirmation of the replay-representation gap.
8. **Turn stall right after tool-call emission (user screenshot,
   2026-08-26 ~11:57)**: a cursor/grok-4.6 High session in the Codex app
   ended its turn immediately after printing "[Tool call:
   mcp_opencodex-responses_exec] / input" — tool call emitted, turn died
   before the round trip. Matches P13b-adjacent risk: custom_tool_call
   completes, stream closes with response.completed, and the app renders
   a dead turn. UNKNOWN split: adapter closed the turn early vs app-side
   loop drop — needs a captured SSE trace of a stalling session.
9. **Injected token corruption in replayed history (S2a transcript)**:
   a stray token (" mar") spliced into tool results and structural
   markers: "is_error mar: false", "jun mar staff", "[ martool_result]",
   "[ martool_ marresult]". Corruption sits INSIDE replayed [tool_result]
   text envelopes — produced on the replay/blob path
   (protobuf-request.ts root blob candidates / blob hydration), not by
   the local shell. Live confirmation of 001 S3 with a concrete
   signature: token-level splicing at high replay volume.
10. **Hook/verification storm interaction (S1a)**: the codexclaw
    SubagentStop evidence hook re-prompted the cursor worker 3 times;
    each re-prompt re-entered the degraded replay loop, multiplying
    cost. Not an adapter bug per se, but cursor-route sessions amplify
    any re-prompting supervisor.
11. **Scratch-fence violation (S1a)**: the cursor worker wrote receipts
    into repo .codexclaw/evidence/ despite scratch-only instruction
    (the evidence hook demanded that path — instruction conflict
    resolved toward the hook). Receipts left in place, noted here.
12. **Fleet reaping**: all three S1 workers reached their final message
    but wait_agent kept timing out; each reported previous_status
    "interrupted" at close. Completion signaling did not translate into
    a reapable final status (affects sol too — not cursor-specific;
    recorded for the campaign, attribution MIXED/host-side).
