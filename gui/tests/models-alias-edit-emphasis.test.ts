/**
 * WP2 (devlog/_plan/260830_models_provider_header/050_hover_affordance_and_column_gate.md).
 *
 * The user's requirement was a hover affordance. The independent audit rejected the
 * first reading of it — hover that GATES, i.e. controls hidden until the pointer
 * arrives — because that deletes the alias pencil, the alias-defaults switch and
 * custom-add from the default visual inventory and worsens the exact opacity that
 * 020 exists to fix. What survives is emphasis: the control never leaves layout,
 * tab order, or the accessibility tree, and only its resting contrast changes.
 *
 * These assertions exist to stop a later "tidy up" from quietly turning emphasis
 * back into gating, and to stop the keyboard and touch paths from being dropped
 * while the hover path survives.
