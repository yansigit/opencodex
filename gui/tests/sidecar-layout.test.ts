 * Sidecar card layout contract.
 *
 * Source-text assertions, not rendered measurements: happy-dom performs no layout, so
 * `offsetHeight` here would prove nothing (see the note in
 * codex-auto-switch-controller.test.tsx). Rendered proof was captured in a real browser
 * during the fix; this file's job is to make the specific CSS shape that caused the bug
 * impossible to reintroduce silently.
 *
 * The bug (ko, 1125px viewport): the "웹 검색 사이드카" card rendered its title 17px wide
 * and 147px tall — one glyph per line — and the card grew from 157px to 618px. Separately,
 * the two cards' Select triggers were never on the same baseline (Δ 16px at 2000px, worse
 * as the cards narrowed).
