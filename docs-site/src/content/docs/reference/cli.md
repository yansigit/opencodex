description: Command dispatch, exit codes, and links to every ocx command family.
---

The opencodex CLI is `ocx`. It dispatches on the first command name, with documented aliases such
as `setup`/`init`, `restore`/`eject`, and `models`/`model` reaching the same operation. Unknown
commands and invalid command shapes are errors.

Run `ocx help` (or `ocx --help` / `ocx -h`) for top-level usage. Run `ocx help <command>`,
`ocx <command> --help`, or `ocx <command> -h` for a command registered in the help table. Help and
version commands are read-only: they do not start, stop, install, uninstall, or rewrite Codex or
opencodex state.

## Command families

### `ocx alias`

`ocx alias list [--json]` shows effective user and built-in aliases. Use `ocx alias set <provider>[/<native-model-id>] <alias>` and `ocx alias rm <provider>[/<native-model-id>]` to edit them. Native model ids may contain additional slashes because the selector splits only at the first slash. Enable shipped defaults with `ocx alias defaults on|off [--provider <name>]`.

- [Lifecycle](/reference/cli/lifecycle/) — setup, proxy and service lifecycle, health, diagnostics,
  catalog sync, the dashboard, and updates.
- [Providers, accounts, and models](/reference/cli/providers-accounts/) — provider configuration,
  authentication, credential pools, quota, custom models, visibility, selected models, and context
  caps.
- [Agents, routing, and integrations](/reference/cli/agents/) — multi-agent controls, combos,
  observability, admission keys, client integrations, runtime settings, and validated configuration.

## Headless behavior

Management commands round-trip the live proxy's management API, using the recorded runtime port and
identity checks rather than maintaining a second configuration path. A stopped or unreachable proxy
is represented as HTTP 503 and produces a nonzero CLI exit. Commands explicitly documented as
offline configuration operations can instead validate and edit the config file without a live
proxy.

List or status is the default where unambiguous. Use `--json` for structured snapshots and
`ocx observe logs --follow --jsonl` for a streaming request-log feed. Theme, language, navigation,
and other purely visual browser state have no CLI equivalent; Cloudflare Tunnel setup is outside
this command set.

## Exit codes and confirmation

Successful commands exit 0. Invalid usage, unknown commands or resources, failed API operations,
and unavailable required services exit nonzero. `ocx health` specifically exits 0 only when the
proxy is healthy and 1 otherwise, so it can be used as a service probe. Scripts should test the exit
code instead of scraping human-readable output.

Destructive removal, import, credit-consumption, and update operations that advertise confirmation
require `--yes` in non-interactive use. The flag is an explicit opt-in; omitting it must not silently
confirm the action.

## Version and internal dispatch targets

`ocx --version`, `ocx -v`, and `ocx version` print one script-friendly version line and exit.

Two dispatch targets are intentionally omitted from normal help: `__refresh-version [preview]`
refreshes the update-notification cache in a detached process, and
`__gui-update-worker <job-id> [latest|preview] [restart]` runs a dashboard update job. They are
implementation details, not stable user-facing commands. The dashboard records the worker PID,
recovers an active job whose worker died, treats older PID-less active records as stale after ten
minutes, and protects a live worker from concurrent updates.
