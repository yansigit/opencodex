title: Proxy API Formats
description: Wire-level reference for the Responses, Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, model catalog, WebSocket, realtime, and compaction surfaces.
---

opencodex presents one local proxy in several client dialects. A Codex client can speak the
Responses API, an OpenAI-compatible app can speak Chat Completions, and Claude Code can speak
Anthropic Messages without requiring every upstream provider to implement every format.

The normal translation path is:

```text
client dialect → internal Responses model → provider adapter → provider wire format
provider events → internal adapter events → client dialect
```

The Responses representation is the center of the bridge. Native-compatible routes may skip parts
of the translation and pass a request through, but authentication, routing, admission control, and
response safety still happen at the proxy boundary. Configure the listener and admission keys in
[Configuration](/reference/configuration/); use [Combos](/guides/combos/) when one public model id
should select among several targets.

## Endpoint overview

| Client surface | Endpoint | Successful non-stream result | Successful stream or socket result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI Responses | `POST /v1/responses` | Responses JSON | Responses SSE, or Responses JSON text frames over WebSocket |
| OpenAI Chat Completions | `POST /v1/chat/completions` | `chat.completion` JSON | `chat.completion.chunk` SSE ending in `[DONE]` |
| Anthropic Messages | `POST /v1/messages` | Anthropic `message` JSON | Anthropic Messages SSE |
| Anthropic token count | `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` | `{ "input_tokens": number }` | Not applicable |
| Model discovery | `GET /v1/models` | One of three catalog contracts | Not applicable |
| Voice and Realtime | `POST /v1/live`, `POST /v1/realtime/calls` | Relayed call-creation response | A separate sideband WebSocket relays frames in both directions |
| Responses compaction | `POST /v1/responses/compact` | Replacement-history JSON | Not applicable |

## `POST /v1/responses`

This is the native opencodex data-plane shape. The request body must be a JSON object with a
non-empty `model`. `input` may be a string or an array of Responses items.

### Accepted request fields

| Area | Accepted shape |
| --- | --- |
| Model and input | Required non-empty `model`; optional string `input` or an item array |
| Message items | `user`, `developer`, `system`, and `assistant` messages; string content or typed content blocks appropriate to the role |
| Content blocks | Text, input images, input files, output text, refusals, and reasoning summary/text blocks where their parent item permits them |
| Tool history | `function_call`, `function_call_output`, `custom_tool_call`, and `custom_tool_call_output` items |
| Tools | Function tools plus loose built-in or hosted tool entries; `tool_choice` accepts `auto`, `none`, `required`, named function/custom choices, hosted choices, or `allowed_tools` |
| Reasoning | `reasoning.effort` and `reasoning.summary` (`auto`, `concise`, `detailed`, or `none`) |
| Continuation and caching | `previous_response_id`, `store`, and `prompt_cache_key` |
| Generation controls | `max_output_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `stop`, `presence_penalty`, and `frequency_penalty` |
| Service and execution | `stream`, `service_tier`, `parallel_tool_calls`, `instructions`, `metadata`, and `user` |
| Extended Responses fields | `background`, `include`, `prompt`, `text`, and `truncation` are accepted for compatible routes |

### Google provider options

Responses requests may opt into a strict Google GenerateContent extension under
`provider_options.google`:

```json
{
  "model": "gemini-3.7-flash",
  "input": "Explain this result",
  "provider_options": {
    "google": {
      "thinking_budget": 4096,
      "include_thoughts": false,
      "safety_settings": [
        {
          "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT",
          "threshold": "BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE"
        }
      ],
      "cached_content": "cachedContents/my-cache"
    }
  }
}
```

The accepted keys are exactly `thinking_budget`, `include_thoughts`,
`safety_settings`, and `cached_content`; unknown keys at either nested level,
or unknown safety-setting keys, fail request validation. The parser maps these
snake-case request fields to typed internal fields; they are not arbitrary
provider passthrough data.

- `thinking_budget` must be a safe integer greater than or equal to `-1`.
  An explicit budget takes precedence over the routed model's derived thinking
  level. `include_thoughts` augments the resulting thinking configuration, and
  an explicit `false` is preserved.
- `safety_settings` accepts at most 16 entries, with no duplicate categories.
  Categories are `HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH`,
  `HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT`, `HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT`,
  `HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT`, `HARM_CATEGORY_CIVIC_INTEGRITY`, and
  `HARM_CATEGORY_JAILBREAK`. Thresholds are
  `HARM_BLOCK_THRESHOLD_UNSPECIFIED`, `BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE`,
  `BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE`, `BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH`, `BLOCK_NONE`, and `OFF`.
- `cached_content` must be exactly one of these Google resource-name forms:
  `cachedContents/{id}` for AI Studio, or
  `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/cachedContents/{cachedContent}` for
  Vertex. Each segment must be non-empty; whitespace, query strings, fragments,
  and extra segments are rejected.

The extension is supported only when the final route uses the Google adapter in
AI Studio or Vertex mode. Cloud Code Assist (including the
`google-antigravity` provider) and every non-Google route are rejected with a
400 before an upstream request is made. This check is applied after routing and
adapter overrides are resolved, including retry and fallback paths.

`cached_content` opts into reuse of a provider-side Google cache that already
exists; it is not a local prompt-cache key. The resource name identifies
provider-managed content, so use it only when the caller is authorized to reuse
that content and accepts Google's retention and access policies. opencodex does
not create, inspect, or delete the provider cache through this field.

Unknown item types are accepted as loose typed items for forward compatibility. Translated adapters
handle only the item types they recognize, and may reject a feature their provider cannot represent.

### JSON and SSE output

With `stream: true`, the response is `text/event-stream`. The bridge emits Responses events such as
`response.created`, output-item and text/tool deltas, and exactly one terminal
`response.completed`, `response.failed`, or `response.incomplete` event. A normal stream ends with
`data: [DONE]`.

With `stream: false` or no `stream`, the same adapter events are collected into one Responses JSON
object. Both forms preserve the selected model, output items, terminal status, and usage.

Client-facing Responses SSE frames are limited to 4 MiB per frame, measured in raw bytes before the
SSE block delimiter. On HTTP, an unterminated upstream frame that exceeds the limit fails closed
with a synthetic `response.failed` event followed by `data: [DONE]`. On the Responses WebSocket
bridge, the same condition emits a 502 `websocket_protocol_error` and cancels the upstream reader.
A complete Responses terminal frame is authoritative: oversized or malformed trailing bytes after
that terminal are dropped rather than replacing the completed turn with a transport failure.

For canonical ChatGPT forward streaming, stable Bun 1.4.0 or newer may transparently use
Codex's upstream WebSocket transport. Bundled Bun 1.3.14, prereleases, and unverifiable runtime
identities use HTTP/SSE. The upstream WS adapter keeps the same downstream SSE contract, caps both
the raw JSON frame and its SSE envelope at 4 MiB, and closes the upstream when its 8 MiB byte queue
would overflow. That overflow emits a terminal downstream `response.failed` event followed by
`[DONE]`.

Every terminal Responses usage object includes both detail objects, even when the provider did not
report those details:

```json
{
  "input_tokens": 0,
  "output_tokens": 0,
  "total_tokens": 0,
  "input_tokens_details": { "cached_tokens": 0 },
  "output_tokens_details": { "reasoning_tokens": 0 }
}
```

When available, `input_tokens_details` can also include `cache_write_tokens`. The always-present
detail objects are a compatibility guarantee for strict Responses clients; zero can mean “not
reported,” not necessarily “the provider performed no such work.”

### WebSocket upgrade on the same path

When `websockets` is enabled, a client may upgrade `/v1/responses` instead of opening an HTTP POST.
Authentication and origin admission happen during the WebSocket handshake. They are not repeated
inside each frame.

This client-facing upgrade is separate from the transparent upstream ChatGPT WebSocket selection
described above; the `websockets` setting controls only the client-facing endpoint.

The client sends JSON text frames:

```json
{
  "type": "response.create",
  "model": "provider/model",
  "input": "Hello",
  "tools": [],
  "generate": true
}
```

Everything except `type` becomes the Responses request body, and the proxy forces streaming for the
turn. A new `response.create` supersedes and cancels the previous turn on that socket.
`response.processed` is accepted as a no-op acknowledgement. Unparseable or unrelated frame types
are ignored.

Server frames are JSON text frames. Successful streamed output uses the same JSON payloads that
would appear in SSE `data:` lines, without the SSE envelope or `[DONE]`. A non-streaming internal
result is reframed as `response.created`, zero or more `response.output_item.done` frames, then a
terminal frame. Errors use this envelope:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "status": 502,
  "error": {
    "type": "upstream_error",
    "message": "..."
  },
  "headers": {}
}
```

A warmup frame with `generate: false` does not call an upstream. It returns a synthetic
`response.created` followed by `response.completed`, both with an empty response id and no output.

:::note
When WebSockets are disabled, an upgrade attempt receives HTTP 426 with code
`upgrade_required`. Codex treats that handshake result as a signal to fall back to HTTP for the
session. It is not a failed model turn.
:::

## `POST /v1/chat/completions`

This endpoint accepts OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions requests with a required `model` and a
non-empty `messages` array. It translates system, user, assistant, and tool messages into internal
Responses items; translates function tools, tool choice, images, reasoning effort, and supported
response formats; runs the normal Responses routing pipeline; then translates the result back.

Reasoning is part of that translation. `reasoning_effort` (or `reasoning.effort`) becomes
internal `reasoning.effort`. Because the Responses parser hides thinking unless
`reasoning.summary` is set and is not `none`, Chat Completions requests that ask for an
effort default to `reasoning.summary: "auto"` so thinking streams back as
`delta.reasoning_content`. Clients can still hide traces with `include_reasoning: false` or
`reasoning.summary: "none"`. An explicit `reasoning.summary` of `auto`, `concise`,
`detailed`, or `none` wins over `include_reasoning`.

Structured output is part of that translation. `response_format` with `json_object` or
`json_schema` is forwarded to routed `openai-chat` models, subject to the provider's
`noStructuredOutputModels` opt-out: listed models omit `response_format`, while sibling models
keep it. Routed Google models lower supported requests to Gemini JSON mode
(`responseMimeType` / `responseSchema`), but skip that lowering when the request has tools, the
selected model is Claude, or the model is image-capable. Kiro rejects structured output.
Cursor has no structured-output wire field and rejects before transport.

On `POST /v1/responses`, the equivalent request field is `text.format`: native Responses routes
preserve it in the raw Responses body, and it is translated to `response_format` when the model
routes to an `openai-chat` provider. Adapter behavior is capability-specific: an adapter may
forward, skip, ignore, or reject a feature according to its implementation, rather than every
unrepresentable feature failing closed.

Non-streaming output has `object: "chat.completion"`. Streaming output uses SSE objects with
`object: "chat.completion.chunk"`, choice deltas, a terminal choice with `finish_reason`, and
`data: [DONE]`. Tool-call and usage information are translated back where the source events carry
them.

## `POST /v1/messages` and `count_tokens`

These endpoints speak the Anthropic Messages dialect used by Claude Code and compatible clients.
Most requests are translated to Responses, routed normally, then translated back to Anthropic JSON
or Anthropic SSE.

Native Anthropic passthrough is eligible only when all of these are true:

- native passthrough has not been disabled in Claude Code configuration;
- the requested model begins with `claude` or `anthropic`;
- the request carries a native Anthropic bearer or `x-api-key` credential;
- on a non-loopback listener, the request also carries valid proxy admission only in
  `x-opencodex-api-key`; and
- no configured alias or model map claims that model id for a routed target.

An eligible request is forwarded in the Anthropic dialect so native beta headers, thinking
signatures, and subscription identity remain end to end. Otherwise it takes the Responses
round-trip.

The dedicated admission header is never forwarded. Proxy admission secrets found in
`Authorization` or `x-api-key` are also removed; a separate genuine Anthropic credential is
preserved. Ambiguous comma-joined credential headers fail closed instead of being forwarded.

`POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` follows the same model resolution and passthrough decision. A
native-eligible request is forwarded to Anthropic's count endpoint. Other requests use the local
documented estimate over system content, messages, and tools and return:

```json
{ "input_tokens": 123 }
```

## `GET /v1/models`

The same route serves three clients that expect incompatible catalog envelopes. Anthropic flavor
wins unless `client_version` is also present.

| Contract | Trigger | Top-level shape | Model-id behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Anthropic model list | `anthropic-version` header or `?flavor=anthropic`, without `client_version` | `{ "data": [...] }` with Anthropic model-info entries | Claude Code receives readable ids; Desktop can receive its profile-specific alias family |
| Codex catalog | `client_version` query parameter | `{ "models": [...] }` | Native and routed entries carry the richer Codex catalog fields, visibility, effort, WebSocket, and multi-agent metadata |
| Plain OpenAI list | Neither trigger | `{ "object": "list", "data": [...] }` | Visible native ids are bare; routed ids are aliases or `provider/model` |

## `POST /v1/live` and Realtime sideband

`POST /v1/live` accepts the ChatGPT/Codex App Frameless call-creation surface.
`POST /v1/realtime/calls` accepts the OpenAI Realtime call-creation surface. opencodex selects an
eligible OpenAI-family route, normalizes the call-creation request for the upstream authentication
mode, and relays the bounded response.

After call creation, clients may join a sideband WebSocket using any supported inbound form:

- `/v1/live/{callId}`
- `/v1/realtime/calls/{callId}`
- `/v1/realtime?call_id={callId}`

The proxy normalizes the upstream join URL and then transparently relays text and binary frames in
both directions. Client protocol headers are preserved while upstream authentication remains
proxy-owned.

## `POST /v1/responses/compact`

Compaction returns replacement history for clients that need to shorten a long Responses
conversation.

| Route type | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical ChatGPT or official OpenAI route | Forwards the request to the native `/responses/compact` endpoint with the resolved account and model authentication |
| Other routed model | Runs an internal, non-streaming, no-tools compaction turn with a `compaction_trigger`; requires exactly one synthetic `compaction` item whose `encrypted_content` is an `ocx1:` envelope; decodes that summary into v1 replacement history |

Native compact responses are buffered with a 32 MiB maximum, including responses whose declared
`Content-Length` already exceeds the limit. The compact-specific failures include:

| Status | Type or code | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `invalid_request_error` | Invalid JSON/body shape or missing model |
| 404 | `invalid_request_error` | The requested model cannot be routed |
| 499 | `client_cancelled` | The client cancelled while forwarding or buffering |
| 502 | `compact_response_too_large` | Native compact output exceeded 32 MiB |
| 502 | `upstream_error` | Connection, read, or synthetic compaction turn failure |
| 502 | `invalid_response_error` | The synthetic turn did not produce exactly one valid, non-empty `ocx1:` compaction item |

## Authentication matrix

On a loopback-only bind, data-plane admission does not require a configured key. On a remote bind,
use the matrix below. “Dedicated” means `X-OpenCodex-API-Key`; the other columns mean
`Authorization: Bearer ...` and `x-api-key`.

| Surface | Dedicated | Bearer | `x-api-key` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/v1/responses` HTTP and WebSocket | Required | Rejected for proxy admission | Rejected |
| `/v1/responses/compact` | Required | Rejected for proxy admission | Rejected |
| `/v1/chat/completions` | Required | Rejected for proxy admission | Rejected |
| `/v1/messages` and `/v1/messages/count_tokens` | Accepted | Accepted | Accepted |
| `/v1/models` | Accepted | Accepted | Accepted |
| `/v1/live`, `/v1/realtime/calls`, and sideband joins | Accepted | Accepted | Accepted |

Responses-family and Chat requests reserve `Authorization` for provider or Codex Direct
passthrough, so a remote proxy key must use the dedicated header. Messages and Realtime surfaces
need broader client compatibility and therefore accept all three forms.

:::caution
Data-plane keys are not management credentials. The management API uses a separate admin secret;
see [Management API](/reference/management-api/). Never reuse one secret for both planes.
:::

## Common error vocabulary

Errors use the client dialect's envelope where needed, but these status/code meanings are stable:

| Status | Type or code | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 401 | `authentication_error` | A required proxy admission credential is missing or invalid |
| 403 | `origin_rejected` | A Responses/OpenAI data-plane request or WebSocket upgrade came from a disallowed origin |
| 503 | `combo_unavailable` | Every target in the selected combo is unavailable, in cooldown, disabled, or otherwise ineligible |
| 400 | `unreadable_encrypted_agent_task` | An encrypted v2 worker task has no eligible native ChatGPT target that can consume it |
| 426 | `upgrade_required` | The Responses WebSocket transport is disabled or the upgrade failed; use HTTP |

Anthropic-origin failures are rendered in Anthropic's error envelope, so the origin rejection is a
403 `permission_error` on that dialect rather than the OpenAI-style `origin_rejected` body.

## Encrypted-content hygiene

The proxy treats genuine backend ciphertext as opaque. Structurally valid ciphertext is preserved
byte for byte: opencodex does not decrypt it, translate its contents, or re-encrypt it for another
provider.

Some agent hooks have historically placed plaintext control text in an `encrypted_content` slot.
For compatibility, the proxy separates that plaintext into text parts while retaining any
structurally valid Fernet runs unchanged. If an `agent_message` loses all encrypted parts during
that repair, it becomes a normal user message. If a current v2 task remains genuinely encrypted
but the selected routed target cannot read native ChatGPT ciphertext, opencodex fails with
`unreadable_encrypted_agent_task` instead of sending unreadable bytes to that provider. See
[Sub-agent Surface](/guides/sub-agent-surface/) for the client behavior around worker tasks.
