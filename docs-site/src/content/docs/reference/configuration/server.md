Server settings control how the local proxy listens, protects remote traffic, manages resources, and
runs helper features around provider requests.

## Server fields

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `port` | `number` | `10100` | Proxy listen port. |
| `hostname?` | `string` | `"127.0.0.1"` | Bind address. Non-loopback binds require `OPENCODEX_API_AUTH_TOKEN`. |
| `proxy?` | `string` | — | Outbound HTTP(S) proxy URL or `${ENV_VAR}`. Applied to `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` only when those variables are unset; loopback remains in `NO_PROXY`. |
| `noProxy?` | `string \| string[]` | — | Hosts that bypass `proxy`, merged with inherited `NO_PROXY` and loopback entries. A string may use comma-separated `NO_PROXY` syntax or `${ENV_VAR}`. |
| `emptyCompletionRetry?` | `boolean` | `false` | Opt in to one identical Responses retry when a turn has no text or tool call, including a stream that ends before a terminal event. The retry may be billable. `OCX_EMPTY_COMPLETION_RETRY=0` disables it without changing config; combo and routed-compaction turns remain excluded. |
| `stallTimeoutSec?` | `number` | `300` | Seconds without upstream data before `response.incomplete`. Minimum 1. |
| `oauthOpenBrowser?` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether a login may open a browser on the machine running the proxy. Absent and `true` both open, so an existing install is unchanged; only an explicit `false` declines. Decline when you need the authorization link in a different browser profile, or when the dashboard is not on the proxy's machine — the login still starts and the URL is still returned and displayed. `POST /api/oauth/login` and `POST /api/codex-auth/login` accept a per-request `openBrowser` boolean that overrides this, and the dashboard exposes the same choice beside the login button. Device-code flows never open a browser either way. |
| `connectTimeoutMs?` | `number` | `200000` | Per-attempt DNS/TCP/TLS/final-header deadline; it ends before body generation. |
| `shutdownTimeoutMs?` | `number` | `5000` | Graceful drain deadline before active turns are aborted. |
| `websockets?` | `boolean` | `false` | Advertise and admit the client-facing Responses WebSocket path. False keeps clients on HTTP/SSE; it does not disable an eligible canonical ChatGPT upstream WS optimization. |
| `corsAllowOrigins?` | `string[]` | `[]` | Additional exact origins allowed by CORS. Loopback origins are always allowed. Authority-based browser extension origins such as `chrome-extension://<extension-id>` are supported; `*` is not a wildcard. Firefox and Safari regenerate the extension UUID (per install / per browser launch), so update the entry when the origin changes. |
| `apiKeys?` | `OcxApiKey[]` | `[]` | Generated `ocx_…` credentials accepted by management and data-plane auth on non-loopback binds. Dashboard-managed. |
| `storageCleanupPolicy?` | `StorageCleanupPolicy` | disabled | Opt-in archived-session cleanup policy. Never enabled implicitly. |
| `appOwnedMemoryBudgetMb?` | `number` | `256` | Cap in MiB for evictable app-owned logs, caches, blobs, and continuation payloads. Range 64–4096; not an RSS cap. |
| `codexAutoStart?` | `boolean` | `true` | Let the Codex shim run `ocx ensure` before launching Codex. False makes ensure a no-op. |
| `codexShimAutoRestore?` | `boolean` | `true` | Restore an installed shim after a completed external Codex update replaces it. Environment opt-out: `OPENCODEX_CODEX_SHIM_AUTO_RESTORE=0`. |
| `syncResumeHistory?` | `boolean` | `true` | Reversible Codex App history compatibility. Original metadata is backed up and restored by `ocx stop` / `ocx restore`. |
| `shadowCallIntercept?` | `{ enabled?: boolean; model?: string; sourceModels?: string[] }` | off | Redirect recognized Codex helper/shadow calls to a chosen model at low effort. The default source prefix is `gpt-5.6-luna`; older clients through 0.144.x used `gpt-5.4-mini`, which `sourceModels` can restore. |
| `webSearchSidecar?` | `OcxWebSearchSidecarConfig` | on when usable | Web-search sidecar options. |
| `visionSidecar?` | `OcxVisionSidecarConfig` | on when usable | Image-description sidecar options. |
| `images?` | `OcxImagesConfig` | automatic OpenAI selection | Standalone Images relay options for Codex `image_gen`. |

`noProxy` accepts either a comma-separated string or an array. Both forms add entries without
replacing an inherited `NO_PROXY`:

```jsonc
{ "proxy": "http://proxy.corp:8080", "noProxy": "internal.example,10.0.0.0/8" }
```

```jsonc
{ "proxy": "http://proxy.corp:8080", "noProxy": ["internal.example", "10.0.0.0/8"] }
```

If an older development build changed resume-history metadata before backup support existed, run
`ocx recover-history --legacy-openai --yes` to force native-provider recovery.
It force-relabels every user-message `opencodex` row, including legitimate dedicated-provider
history; review the full-scope warning in the lifecycle reference before running it.

## Remote access

The default `127.0.0.1` bind is loopback-only. A non-loopback address such as `0.0.0.0` requires
token authentication on both `/api/*` and the data plane. Export the token before starting:

```bash
export OPENCODEX_API_AUTH_TOKEN="your-secret-token"
ocx start
```

The proxy refuses a remote bind without this variable. For a background service, export it before
`ocx service install` so launchd, systemd, or Task Scheduler receives it. Clients should send:

```text
x-opencodex-api-key: your-secret-token
```

| Endpoint | `Authorization: Bearer` | `x-opencodex-api-key` | `x-api-key` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/v1/responses` | not accepted | **required** | not accepted |
| `/v1/chat/completions` | not accepted | **required** | not accepted |
| `/v1/messages` | accepted | accepted | accepted |
| `/v1/messages/count_tokens` | accepted | accepted | accepted |
| `/v1/models` | accepted | accepted | accepted |

Responses and Chat Completions reserve `Authorization` for possible Codex Direct passthrough, so only
the dedicated admission header is accepted there. Dashboard-generated `apiKeys` may replace the
environment token after startup; candidates are compared in constant time.

Messages and `count_tokens` keep accepting all three admission forms for routed-client compatibility. Native
Anthropic passthrough is stricter on a non-loopback bind: proxy admission must use
`x-opencodex-api-key`, while `Authorization` and `x-api-key` are reserved for Anthropic credentials.
Any proxy admission secret placed in those provider headers is removed before forwarding.

:::caution[LAN exposure]
A `0.0.0.0` bind exposes the proxy and configured provider access to the LAN. Use it only on trusted
networks with a strong token.
:::

### Local clients that cannot receive the token

A remote bind requires a credential from every caller, including local ones. That breaks a specific
case: a `codex app-server` launched by a host process that resolves the Codex entrypoint directly
(`require.resolve('@openai/codex/bin/codex.js')`) never passes through the generated `codex` shim,
so it never inherits `OPENCODEX_API_AUTH_TOKEN` and every model call fails with `401` before a
stream opens.

`unauthenticatedLoopbackListener` opens a second listener bound to `127.0.0.1` that admits without a
credential. The main listener is untouched — remote callers still need the token.

```json
{
  "hostname": "0.0.0.0",
  "port": 10100,
  "unauthenticatedLoopbackListener": { "enabled": true, "port": 10200 }
}
```

`ocx sync` then writes `base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:10200/v1"` into the managed Codex provider block
and omits the auth header, so a directly spawned app-server works without any credential plumbing.

The port is required and must differ from the proxy port. It is never OS-assigned: an ephemeral port
would change across restarts while already-running app-servers kept the previous `base_url`.

The listener serves only `POST /v1/responses`, its WebSocket upgrade, `POST /v1/responses/compact`,
and `GET /v1/models`. Everything else, including `/api/*` and the dashboard, returns `404`.

:::danger[This is an unauthenticated surface]
Every process on the machine can use this listener. It spends account quota and paid provider
credentials, and it can exhaust the shared turn capacity that authenticated remote clients depend
on. Do not enable it on a shared or multi-tenant host.

Binding to `127.0.0.1` means the kernel refuses remote connections, but it does not stop a browser:
a page you visit can make your browser connect to `127.0.0.1`. The listener therefore applies the
same `Host` and `Origin` checks as an ordinary loopback bind. Off by default.
:::

### SSH port forwarding

Remote use does not require a remote bind. Keep loopback and forward it:

```bash
ssh -L 20100:localhost:10100 you@remote
```

Any local port works. Requests whose Host resolves to `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1` remain
loopback regardless of port, so `http://localhost:20100/v1` works. Set that base URL in the client;
`ocx` writes only the default local `127.0.0.1` address into managed client config.

Provider OAuth callbacks listen on a fixed remote port. Log in on the remote machine or forward that
port too:

```bash
ssh -L 20100:localhost:10100 -L 1455:localhost:1455 you@remote
```

If a registered callback port is already in use and the login surface offers manual input, OpenCodex
keeps the registered redirect URI and still returns the provider authorization URL. Complete the
provider login, then paste the final redirect URL from the browser address bar or the authorization
code into OpenCodex. The pending flow preserves state and PKCE validation. Callers without manual
input still fail closed.

:::caution[Forwarded loopback is unauthenticated]
Plain `ssh -L` listens on your local loopback and is safe for the default unauthenticated bind. Do not
use `ssh -g -L`, broad container publishing, or forwarding modes that expose the client side on
`0.0.0.0`. Bind explicitly with `ssh -L 127.0.0.1:20100:localhost:10100` when unsure.
:::

## Storage cleanup

`storageCleanupPolicy` is disabled by default. When enabled, it runs on `startup`, `daily`, `weekly`,
or `manual` after archived bytes exceed `trigger.archivedBytesOver`. It selects oldest archives toward
either `target.reduceToBytes` or `target.removeOldestPercent`. `mode` defaults to `quarantine`; use
`permanent` only as an explicit destructive choice. The policy persists `lastRun` and `nextRun`.
Configure it on the Storage page or with `GET`/`PUT /api/storage/cleanup-policy`; trigger a manual run
with `POST /api/storage/cleanup-policy/run`.

## Claude Code (`claudeCode`)

These settings govern `/v1/messages`, `/v1/messages/count_tokens`, the `ocx claude` launcher, and the Claude dashboard page.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `claudeCode.bodyStallSec?` | `number` | `90` | Native-passthrough body inactivity budget in seconds while a read is pending, not total duration. Minimum 1; exactly `0` disables. |
| `claudeCode.bodyMaxBytes?` | `number` | `67108864` | Cumulative native-passthrough body cap for streamed and buffered responses. Exactly `0` disables. |
| `claudeCode.authMode?` | `"proxy" \| "subscription"` | auto | How launch handles `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`. Auto detects auth each launch; an explicit value is never overridden. |
| `claudeCode.authModeMigratedAt?` | `string` | unset | Internal one-time upgrade marker. Do not set manually. |
| `claudeCode.classifierModel?` | `string` | unset | Explicit target for Claude Code Auto Mode classifier turns, as a qualified `provider/model` (for example `RelayA/claude-opus-5`). Auto Mode sends bare safety checks such as `claude-opus-5` with no provider, so without this they fall through to `defaultProvider` — which may not speak Anthropic at all. Nothing is inferred automatically: only a target you declare here is used. |
| `claudeCode.classifierFallbacks?` | `string[]` | unset | Ordered classifier targets used when `classifierModel` is not set. Same qualified `provider/model` form; the first usable entry wins. An explicit `modelMap` entry for the classifier model still outranks both. |
| `claudeCode.subagentEffort?` | `"low" \| "medium" \| "high" \| "xhigh" \| "max"` | inherit | Effort written to generated `~/.claude/agents/ocx-*.md`; separate from Codex guidance and proxy caps. Restart through `ocx claude` to regenerate. |

Auto auth selects subscription when stored Claude auth is found, proxy when none is found, and
subscription with a warning when detection is inconclusive. See
[Claude Code auth mode](/guides/claude-code/#auth-mode).

## Shadow calls

Codex uses small helper models for tasks such as titles and commit messages. Enable
`shadowCallIntercept` to redirect recognized source-model prefixes to another configured model. The
replacement runs at low effort. Set `sourceModels` only when a client uses different helper ids.
Codex 0.145.0+ marks request purpose in `x-codex-turn-metadata`: normal `request_kind: "turn"`
requests keep the selected model, while recognized maintenance requests can be redirected. Clients
without that metadata retain the legacy prefix behavior.

```json
{
  "shadowCallIntercept": {
    "enabled": true,
    "model": "gpt-5.5",
    "sourceModels": ["gpt-5.6-luna"]
  }
}
```

## Sidecars

### `images` (`OcxImagesConfig`)

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `provider?` | `string` | automatic OpenAI selection | Explicit custom API-key `openai-responses` provider for `/v1/images/generations` and `/v1/images/edits`. Registry-managed ids are rejected. |
| `timeoutMs?` | `number` | `300000` | Whole-request timeout for one standalone Images request. |

Explicit selection fails closed when the provider is missing, disabled, incompatible, or lacks a
usable key; it never falls back to another paid upstream. The endpoint must implement the OpenAI
Images API paths and response shape expected by Codex.

### `webSearchSidecar` (`OcxWebSearchSidecarConfig`)

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled?` | `boolean` | on when usable | Master switch. |
| `backend?` | `"openai" \| "anthropic" \| "xai" \| "gemini" \| "exa"` | `openai` | Explicit wins; unset always resolves to `openai`. `anthropic` and `xai` run only when explicitly configured; `gemini` and `exa` remain reserved until their executors ship. |
| `model?` | `string` | backend-dependent | `gpt-5.6-luna` for OpenAI, `claude-sonnet-5` for Anthropic, or `grok-4.6` for xAI. Legacy explicit `gpt-5.4-mini` migrates on start. |
| `exaApiKey?` | `string` | none | Operator key for the `exa` backend. Write-only: management reads never return the stored value. |
| `xSearch?` | `object` | omitted | xAI-only opt-in for hosted `x_search`: `enabled`, mutually exclusive `allowedXHandles` / `excludedXHandles` arrays (maximum 20), and ISO `fromDate` / `toDate` (`YYYY-MM-DD`). |
| `reasoning?` | `string` | `low` | Sidecar effort. `minimal` is rejected with web search. |
| `maxSearchesPerTurn?` | `number` | `3` | Real searches allowed per main-model turn. |
| `routedModelStallTimeoutMs?` | `number` | `200000` | Config-file-only routed-model raw-body inactivity deadline. Integer 1–2147483647; every non-empty chunk resets it. |
| `timeoutMs?` | `number` | `60000` | Deadline for one hosted search. |

The OpenAI backend requires a ChatGPT login and enabled ChatGPT `forward` provider. Claude-inbound
routed replays inject main ChatGPT auth into the internal request. The Anthropic backend uses the
active stored credential from an enabled Anthropic OAuth provider. An explicitly selected Anthropic
backend with no usable account fails closed instead of falling back. The Anthropic executor uses its
native `web_search_20250305` tool. The xAI backend requires a usable stored Grok OAuth account, uses
hosted `web_search`, and adds hosted `x_search` when `xSearch.enabled` is true. Malformed `xSearch`
management input returns `400`; a malformed persisted block fails closed during planning. The
`gemini` and `exa` lanes never activate from credential discovery or fallback; the operator must
select them explicitly. `exaApiKey` is accepted on writes but omitted from management responses.

Four clocks govern search: base `stallTimeoutSec`, `connectTimeoutMs`, routed-model inactivity, and
hosted-search timeout. The effective bridge watchdog is the maximum plus 30 seconds. Routed stall is
an inactivity guard, not a total generation deadline.

### `visionSidecar` (`OcxVisionSidecarConfig`)

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled?` | `boolean` | on when usable | Master image-description switch. |
| `backend?` | `"openai" \| "anthropic"` | auto | Explicit wins; unset prefers a usable stored Anthropic OAuth credential, else `openai`. |
| `model?` | `string` | backend-dependent | `gpt-5.4-mini` for OpenAI or `claude-sonnet-5` for Anthropic. |
| `maxDescriptionsPerTurn?` | `number` | `8` | New description cache misses admitted per main turn. `0` disables calls; invalid values use default. |
| `timeoutMs?` | `number` | `45000` | Sidecar fetch timeout. Integer 1–2147483647. |

Vision activates only for images sent to a model in its provider's `noVisionModels`. OpenAI has the
same login/forward requirements as search; explicitly selected Anthropic fails closed without a usable
credential. Successful `data:` descriptions use a bounded cache keyed by backend, model, detail,
image bytes, and normalized message context. Hits and same-turn duplicates do not consume the limit.
Remote `https:` images and failed or empty descriptions are not cached.

Anthropic OAuth sidecars reuse opencodex's existing Claude Code OAuth fingerprint. Soak-test the
intended account and workload.
