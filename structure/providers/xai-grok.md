# xAI Grok Provider

## xAI Grok hardening (official Grok Build contract parity)

Grounded in the open-sourced official client (xai-org/grok-build); unit + evidence:
`devlog/_fin/260716_grok_build_hardening/`.

- **Reasoning folding:** the Responses parser folds `reasoning` items into the FOLLOWING
  assistant turn (`pendingReasoning` in `src/responses/parser.ts`) so the Grok chat wire carries
  ONE assistant message with `reasoning_content` — exact-prefix cache stability. Unsigned
  siblings newline-join; `ocxr1`-signed siblings stay separate parts (Anthropic replay keeps
  each signature on its own text); boundaries (user/tool-result/agent) clear pending state;
  call items fold pending reasoning into the same turn.
- **Grok CLI credential ownership:** `source:"local-cli"` xAI credentials re-read
  `~/.grok/auth.json` (read-only) before any refresh and adopt a newer usable generation with
  zero IdP calls (`shouldAdoptGrokGeneration`, later-expiresAt authority); an IdP refresh
  detaches the credential to `source:"oauth"`.
- **Browser login callback:** Grok's browser login uses the shared `OAuthCallbackFlow` listener
  on a per-provider FIXED loopback port, so every response it sends closes its connection. A
  retired flow that kept a pooled socket would capture the NEXT login's callback and reject it
  as a state mismatch; see `src/oauth/callback-server.ts`.
- **Two-lock refresh transaction:** per-provider+account intent lock held across the IdP
  exchange plus a short global store-write lock + async mutation funnel around every
  `auth.json` load-merge-persist (`src/oauth/store.ts`); generation-guarded persist
  (`expectedGeneration` → superseded adoption), conditional `needsReauth`, bounded jittered
  retry for transient token-endpoint failures.
- **Reactive 401 replay:** both the adapter recovery loop and native Responses passthrough branch
  force-refresh once (singleflight, generation-checked) and replay OAuth-backed xAI requests
  exactly once with a re-resolved transport; API-key/BYOK paths are excluded
  (`src/server/responses/core.ts`).
- **Header parity:** per-attempt `x-grok-req-id` (fresh UUID inside the transport fetch
  wrapper), stable session/conv affinity headers, always-set User-Agent, and a single
  compatibility profile const for the Grok client version (`src/providers/xai-transport.ts`);
  `fetchWithHeaderTimeout` takes an executor so provider fetch wrappers stay inside the
  timeout race.

The generated Grok client marker also enables a client-facing sparse-terminal repair for native
Responses streams. Grok Build renders text deltas immediately but derives its durable assistant
turn from `response.completed.response.output`; an OpenAI-compatible stream may instead place the
complete items in `response.output_item.done` and finish with an explicit empty output array. For
that marked client only, OpenCodex uses a terminal-only tracker: it retains bounded, contiguous,
unique and semantically valid raw completed items, then backfills a missing or empty terminal
snapshot. It never promotes locally synthesized or merely repaired items. Unmarked callers continue
to treat an explicit empty array as authoritative. Within this marked client-facing repair,
malformed, gapped, oversized, contradictory, failed, or incomplete streams stay fail-closed.

### Grok Reset Coupons (Billing API Parity)

- **Upstream RPCs:** `prod_mc_billing.ConsumerUiSvc/GetRemainingResets` (inspection) and `prod_mc_billing.ConsumerUiSvc/RedeemReset` (redemption).
- **Transport:** Binary gRPC-Web over HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 with 5-byte frame envelope (`0x00` data / `0x80` trailers) and protobuf wire format. Plain JSON is rejected with empty responses upstream.
- **Authentication:** `Authorization: Bearer <xai OIDC access token>` + `X-XAI-Token-Auth: xai-grok-cli`. No cookies required.
- **Safety & Idempotency:** Managed via `src/grok/reset-coupon-ledger.ts` using UUIDv4 operation tracking before upstream dispatch to prevent duplicate consumption during network flakes.
- **Surfaces:** `ocx account grok-reset-coupons` in the terminal, and the dashboard at Providers > xAI Grok > Accounts, where each OAuth row carries a ticket badge with its remaining count and opens a redemption dialog (`gui/src/hooks/useGrokResetCoupons.ts`, `gui/src/components/provider-workspace/GrokResetCoupons.tsx`). The dashboard reads one `GET /api/grok/reset-coupons` per account with at most three in flight, always sends an explicit `tokenId` and a client-minted `operationId`, and treats redemption truth as the settled `code` rather than HTTP 200 — a replayed *failure* returns 200 with `replayed: true`. After a request times out it issues no further consume call, because a redemption whose ledger record is still `open` re-executes.

Chat helper admission in `src/server/responses/core.ts` follows the
[deferred stored-main contract](openai-tiers.md): only a needed Direct OpenAI helper
claims stored main, after terminal vision, routed vision and search exclusions.

Account-scoped OAuth quota remains display evidence for provider-level Combo selection; it does not acquire single-key inference-veto authority. See [scoped provider quota](../runtime.md#scoped-provider-quota-for-combo-selection).

The management quota DTO keeps Combo editing aligned with scoped inference evidence;
see [Combo editor routing quota](../gui-and-management-api.md#combo-editor-routing-quota).

Claude replay carries [Go conversation affinity](../data-planes/inbound-compat.md#claude-affinity-at-final-go-dispatch)
privately to final dispatch; preliminary route selection does not inject Go-only headers.

Devin CLI credential path composition in `src/oauth/devin-cli.ts` follows the selected platform: Windows uses Win32 APPDATA paths, other platforms use POSIX XDG-data paths. The explicit absolute override remains verbatim; credential parsing and login behavior are unchanged.
