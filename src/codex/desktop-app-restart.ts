/**
 * Full restart of the Codex desktop app (the Electron shell), Windows only.
 *
 * `--restart-codex` deliberately signals only `codex app-server` /
 * `codex-code-mode-host` processes: `isCodexAppServerCommandLine` requires a
 * `codex` executable token, so the shell that owns the model picker is never a
 * match. On macOS that is enough, because the respawned app-server re-emits
 * `codex-app-server-initialized` and the renderer drops its cached
 * `model/list`. On Windows MSIX it is not: externally terminating the child
 * does not reliably re-emit that event in the surviving shell, so the picker
 * keeps showing the old catalog until the app itself is restarted (#2292).
 *
 * This is therefore a SEPARATE opt-in flag rather than a widening of
 * `--restart-codex`. Quitting the desktop app ends live conversations, which is
 * a different consent from restarting a background helper, and the CLI contract
 * for `--restart-codex` promises the narrow behavior.
 *
 * Everything here fails CLOSED: if the package cannot be identified, if a
 * target is part of our own ancestry, or if any target survives termination,
 * nothing is relaunched and the caller is told to restart manually. A stale
 * picker is a much smaller problem than a wrongly killed process.
