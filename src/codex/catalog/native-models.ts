 * `gpt-daybreak-blue-latest` is entitlement-gated upstream: it is absent from codex-rs's
 * bundled catalog and reaches a client only through an authenticated `/models` response.
 * It is listed here by explicit owner decision so the capability template exists without waiting
 * for an observation, because opencodex injects `model_catalog_json` and codex-rs therefore builds
 * a `StaticModelsManager` whose refresh is a no-op — an entitled account had no way to
 * discover it on a clean install.
 *
 * Availability is not static: catalog sync and Pool routing require the account's authenticated
 * `/models` roster to contain account-gated slugs. An unconfirmed or unentitled account never
 * receives the request. `disabledModels` remains the independent user visibility control.
