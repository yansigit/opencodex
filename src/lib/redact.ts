 * This is one pass with an explicit decision rather than a stack of regexes
 * that have to reason about each other's output. Three earlier attempts failed
 * exactly there: exempting `Bearer` let anything the Bearer rule could not
 * parse escape both rules; trusting the public `[REDACTED]` marker let a
 * suffix ride along behind it; and splitting into two ordered patterns had the
 * second eat the first one's result.
 *
 * The rule: the value after the label is a credential and gets masked to
 * end-of-line. There is no "keep the readable part" exception, because every
 * round of review found another way to hide a credential inside whatever the
 * previous round chose to preserve — a second label, a repeated `Bearer`
 * scheme, a third token two levels deep. Preserving attacker-controlled text
 * next to a credential is the bug; the scheme word is not worth it.
 *
 * `Bearer` survives only as a fixed prefix on `authorization` /
 * `proxy-authorization`, where it says which scheme failed and carries nothing
 * from the input. `[REDACTED]` is a PUBLIC string an upstream can emit too, so
 * its presence never grants trust.
 *
 * The label boundary is matched over a NORMALIZED VIEW: colon confusables and
 * invisible format characters are folded for matching only, with offsets mapped
 * back so unrelated text keeps its original bytes. Folding the string itself
 * rewrote innocent diagnostics (`ratio∶1` became `ratio:1`).
