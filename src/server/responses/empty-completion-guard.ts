 * Empty-completion guard for Responses turns (port of codex-router's
 * empty-completion-guard + single retry, PR #145).
 *
 * Failure mode: the upstream answers 200 and completes the turn but never
 * produced output text or a tool call (a reasoning-only stream that ends with
 * nothing is the canonical shape). The client has no code path for "the model
 * said nothing", so it silently records the turn as done — the "random stop"
 * nobody can explain. The guard holds pre-content events (reasoning deltas
 * are deliberately NOT content), and when a terminal event arrives with no
 * content it suppresses the terminal and retries the IDENTICAL turn once
 * (same request bytes, same headers). If the retry is also empty — or fails
 * upstream — the client sees a stated failure instead of a second silent
 * success.
 *
 * The retry is explicitly enabled by top-level config. The environment switch
 * is a disable-only emergency override: OCX_EMPTY_COMPLETION_RETRY=0 restores
 * the previous relay behavior without editing the persisted config.
