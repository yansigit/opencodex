 * Request-scoped CodeWhisperer service profile for AWS Builder ID accounts.

 * Builder ID is a personal identity with no AWS account behind it, so AWS never mints an
 * account-scoped `profile/<id>` ARN for it. The Kiro CLI resolves this the same way: it carries
 * this fixed service profile on Builder ID requests. The embedded account id is Amazon's own, not
 * the user's, which is why sending it is not the same as synthesizing an account identity.
 *
 * Request-scoped is load-bearing. This value must never be persisted into `KiroOAuthMetadata`,
 * never seed region inference (it is `us-east-1` and would pin every Builder ID account there),
 * and never participate in account matching.
