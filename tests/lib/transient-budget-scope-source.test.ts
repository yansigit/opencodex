/**
 * `transientRetryOn5xx.attempts` is ONE request-wide total-send budget, not a per-leg
 * allowance. A Responses request can reach upstream on several legs — the initial send, a
 * 429/account-rotation refetch, and the terminal-guard continuation — and each leg calls
 * `fetchWithTransientRetry` separately. The budget only holds if every leg draws from the
 * shared request-scoped counter.
 *
 * The continuation leg shipped on the raw policy value instead, so a request that reached it
 * received a fresh full `attempts` allowance: with `attempts: 3` an initial send that had
 * already spent its budget could still emit three more upstream sends. Runtime coverage in
 * `tests/providers/upstream-transient-retry.test.ts` proves the helper reports and honors a remainder;
 * it cannot prove that every call site asks for one, because a site that forgets simply
 * passes a larger number. This asserts the wiring at the source, which is the only place the
 * omission is visible.
